    <p class="pc"> In the USFLR, the Lardish language is rarely used due to the abandonment 
        of its development and its lack of words. All schools within the country teach at 
        least one hour of the Lardish language every day. The government decided to promote 
        the use of the language amongst young people, hoping they continue with third phase 
        of the language. The language’s development phases are currently three:
        The first one started with the creation of Lardish in 2018 and ended when Lard 
        Corporation was given ownership of the language, the second phase is considered 
        by Lardish (language) specialists as the downfall of it because Lard Corporation 
        stopped the development of the language. This phase started in 2020 and ended in 2023. 
        The abandonment was caused because they had more important things to deal with at the 
        time, such as restructuring the company, in order to be purchased by the Lardish 
        Government, Lard Corporation’s Ex-CEO, Mr. Josh F. Klindraugt, claims. The third phase
         started on February 2023 with the government’s decision to create an institute 
         dedicated to the development of the language. According to the Lardish law, all official
          documents written in English, or any other language must have an adaptation or 
          translation into Lardish. The process for this adaptation depends on the used words, if
           half of the document’s words or more are in English, a Lardish translation is not 
           possible and can be skipped, however, if the document has less than 100 words, 
           regardless of the previous rule, the document must be translated into Lardish. Any 
           document that can be adapted to Lardish, but isn’t, will not be valid for legal purposes 
           such as document registrations. But this does not mean that it isn’t required to know 
           Lardish to get citizenship, contrary to popular belief, it is one of the many requirements 
           to fluently speak and understand the Lardish language to get Lardish citizenship.
