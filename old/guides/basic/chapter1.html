    <p class="pc"> The United States of the First Lardish Republic recognizes English and Lardish
        as their official language, however, some towns also recognize Russian and Spanish as their 
        official languages. The native language is Lardish, but English is used more commonly due 
        to its lack of words. The Lardish language was created in 2018 by His Majesty Lard Lapudding
         2nd to solve the communication barrier between his family. The purpose of this language was
          to make communication easier between people around the world, as this is an easy language 
          to learn, however after the president ordered that the language would be updated by Lard 
          Corporation, the development of the language has significantly stopped in favor of English.
          This decision to give full ownership of the language to Lard Corporation has affected the 
          language and after the Sovereign-Royal Lardish 2023 War, the President of the USFLR announced 
          it would create an institute dedicated to the development of the language, hoping that it 
          becomes great again. One of the many things to keep in mind when learning Lardish is that in 
          Lardish, words are pronounced the same way they are written.
