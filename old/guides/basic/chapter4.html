        The development of the Lardish language was affected by some ownership changes, 
        therefore, it only has about 70 words. Many of these words are based off English 
        and Spanish, however there is still some Russian presence in some words. Lardish 
        words are pronounced the same way they are written, for example you pronounce 
        “какя” as “kakya”. It is of great importance knowing the letters of the Russian 
        Cyrillic alphabet to understand and speak the language. Below is an image of the 
        full list of words in Lardish.
