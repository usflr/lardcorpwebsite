    <p class="pc"> The Lardish language, according to the Lardish Language Research and Creation 
        Institute, must only be written in Cyrillic script, however, some people write Lardish 
        words using Latin script. This is because when the Lardish language was created, it was 
        established that it would be written in Latin script, to make it easier for people to 
        understand and learn Lardish, but as the language evolved, the creator and his team 
        pointed out that the language was meant to be written in Cyrillic script. The Lardish 
        Government has made a law where all official documents in the Lardish language must be 
        written in Cyrillic. Lardish is written in the Russian variation of the Cyrillic alphabet, 
        however, if there are any changes made to it, those changes shall not be made to the Lardish
        language unless Lard Corporation approves. This variation of the Cyrillic alphabet is taught 
        at schools throughout the country in the Lardish classes. Currently, over 60,000 Lardish 
        speakers normally write the language in Latin script, but at least 85% of this group of 
        people know how to write in Cyrillic script.
